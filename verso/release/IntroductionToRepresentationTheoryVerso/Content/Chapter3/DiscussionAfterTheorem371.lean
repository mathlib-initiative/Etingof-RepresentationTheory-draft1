The Jordan-Holder theorem shows that the number $`n` of terms in a filtration of $`V` with irreducible successive quotients does not depend on the choice of a filtration and depends only on $`V`. This number is called the *length* of $`V`. It is easy to see that $`n` is also the maximal length of a filtration of $`V` in which all the inclusions are strict.

The sequence of the irreducible representations $`W_1, \ldots, W_n` enumerated in the order they appear from some filtration of $`V` as successive quotients is called a *Jordan-Holder series* of $`V`.
