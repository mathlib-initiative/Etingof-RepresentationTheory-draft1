*Remark 5.26.2.* Statement (ii) of Theorem 5.26.1 is equivalent to the same statement with $`\mathbb{Q}`-span replaced by $`\mathbb{C}`-span. Indeed, consider the matrix whose columns consist of the coefficients of the decomposition of $`\operatorname{Ind}_H^G V` (for various $`H, V`) with respect to the irreducible representations of $`G`. Then both statements are equivalent to the condition that the rows of this matrix are linearly independent.
