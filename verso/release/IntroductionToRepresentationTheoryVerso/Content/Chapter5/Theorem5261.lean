*Theorem 5.26.1.* _Let $`X` be a conjugation-invariant system of subgroups of a finite group $`G`. Then two conditions are equivalent:_

_(i) Any element of $`G` belongs to a subgroup $`H \in X`._

_(ii) The character of any irreducible representation of $`G` belongs to the $`\mathbb{Q}`-span of characters of induced representations $`\operatorname{Ind}_H^G V`, where $`H \in X` and $`V` is an irreducible representation of $`H`._
