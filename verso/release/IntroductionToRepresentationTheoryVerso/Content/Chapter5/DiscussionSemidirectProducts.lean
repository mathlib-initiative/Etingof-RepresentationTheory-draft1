Let $`G, A` be groups and let $`\phi : G \to \operatorname{Aut}(A)` be a homomorphism. For $`a \in A`, denote $`\phi(g)a` by $`g(a)`. The *semidirect product* $`G \ltimes A` is defined to be the product $`A \times G` with multiplication law

$$`(a_1, g_1)(a_2, g_2) = (a_1 g_1(a_2), g_1 g_2).`

Clearly, $`G` and $`A` are subgroups of $`G \ltimes A` in a natural way.

We would like to study irreducible complex representations of $`G \ltimes A`. For simplicity, let us do it when $`A` is abelian.

In this case, irreducible representations of $`A` are 1-dimensional and form the character group $`A^\vee`, which carries an action of $`G`. Let $`O` be an orbit of this action, $`x \in O` a chosen element, and $`G_x` the
stabilizer of $`x` in $`G`. Let $`U` be an irreducible representation of $`G_x`. Then we define a representation $`V_{(O,U)}` of $`G \ltimes A` as follows.

As a representation of $`G`, we set

$$`
V_{(O,x,U)} = \operatorname{Ind}_{G_x}^G U = \{f : G \to U | f(hg) = hf(g), h \in G_x\}.
`

Next, we introduce an additional action of $`A` on this space by $`(af)(g) = x(g(a))f(g)`. Then it is easy to check that these two actions combine into an action of $`G \ltimes A`. Also, it is clear that this representation does not really depend on the choice of $`x`, in the following sense. Let $`x, y \in O` and $`g \in G` be such that $`gx = y`, and let $`g(U)` be the representation of $`G_y` obtained from the representation $`U` of $`G_x` by the action of $`g`. Then $`V_{(O,x,U)}` is (naturally) isomorphic to $`V_{(O,y,g(U))}`. Thus we will denote $`V_{(O,x,U)}` by $`V_{(O,U)}` (remembering, however, that $`x` has been fixed).
