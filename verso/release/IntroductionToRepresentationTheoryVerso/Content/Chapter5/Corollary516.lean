*Corollary 5.1.6.* _Assume that all representations of a finite group $`G` are defined over real numbers (i.e., all complex representations of $`G` are obtained by complexifying real representations). Then the sum of the dimensions of all the irreducible representations of $`G` equals the number of involutions in $`G`._
