*Proof.* (i) Let $`Y` be an algebraic representation of $`GL(V)`. We have an embedding $`\xi : Y \to Y \otimes R` given by $`(u, \xi(v))(g) := u(gv)`, $`u \in Y^*`. It is easy to see that $`\xi` is a homomorphism of representations (where the action of $`GL(V)` on the first component of $`Y \otimes R` is trivial). Thus, it suffices to prove the theorem for a subrepresentation $`Y \subset R^m`. Now, every element of $`R` is a polynomial of $`g_{ij}` times a nonpositive power of $`\det(g)`. Thus, $`R` is a quotient of a direct sum of representations of the form $`S^r(V \otimes V^*) \otimes (\wedge^N V^*)^{\otimes s}`, where the group action on $`V^*` in the product $`V \otimes V^*` is trivial. So we may assume that $`Y` is contained in a quotient of a (finite) direct sum of such representations. Thus, $`Y` is contained in a direct sum of representations of the form $`V^{\otimes n} \otimes (\wedge^N V^*)^{\otimes s}`, and we are done.

(ii) Let $`Y` be an algebraic representation of $`GL(V)`, and let us regard $`R` as a representation of $`GL(V)` via $`(\rho(h)\phi)(x) = \phi(xh)`. Then $`\operatorname{Hom}_{GL(V)}(Y, R)` is the space of polynomial functions $`f` on $`GL(V)` with values in $`Y^*` which are right $`GL(V)`-equivariant (i.e., such that $`f(xg) = g^{-1}f(x)`). This space is naturally identified with $`Y^*`. Taking into account the proof of (i), we deduce that $`R` has the required decomposition, which is compatible with the second action of $`GL(V)` (by left multiplications). This implies the statement. $`\square`
