Any two elements in the first row of $`T` must be in different columns of $`T'`, so there exists $`q'_1 \in Q'_\lambda` which moves all these elements to the first row. So there is $`p_1 \in P_\lambda` such that $`p_1 T` and $`q'_1 T'` have the same first row. Now do the same procedure with the second row, finding elements $`p_2, q'_2` such that $`p_2 p_1 T` and $`q'_2 q'_1 T'` have the same first two rows. Continuing so, we will construct the desired elements $`p, q'`. The lemma is proved. $`\square`
