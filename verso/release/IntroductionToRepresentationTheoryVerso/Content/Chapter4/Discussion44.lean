## 4.4. Duals and tensor products of representations

If $`V` is a representation of a group $`G`, then $`V^*` is also a representation, via

$$`\rho_{V^*}(g) = (\rho_V(g)^*)^{-1} = (\rho_V(g)^{-1})^* = \rho_V(g^{-1})^*.`

The character is $`\chi_{V^*}(g) = \chi_V(g^{-1})`.

We have $`\chi_V(g) = \sum \lambda_i`, where the $`\lambda_i` are the eigenvalues of $`g` in $`V`. If $`G` is finite, these eigenvalues must be roots of unity because $`\rho(g)^{|G|} = \rho(g^{|G|}) = \rho(e) = \mathrm{Id}`. Thus for complex representations

$$`\chi_{V^*}(g) = \chi_V(g^{-1}) = \sum \lambda_i^{-1} = \sum \overline{\lambda_i} = \overline{\sum \lambda_i} = \overline{\chi_V(g)}.`

In particular, $`V \cong V^*` as representations (not just as vector spaces) if and only if $`\chi_V(g) \in \mathbb{R}` for all $`g \in G`.

If $`V, W` are representations of $`G`, then $`V \otimes W` is also a representation, via

$$`\rho_{V \otimes W}(g) = \rho_V(g) \otimes \rho_W(g).`

Therefore, $`\chi_{V \otimes W}(g) = \chi_V(g)\chi_W(g)`.

An interesting problem discussed below is decomposing $`V \otimes W` (for irreducible $`V, W`) into the direct sum of irreducible representations.
