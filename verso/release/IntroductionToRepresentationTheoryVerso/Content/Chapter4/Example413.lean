*Example 4.1.3.* If $`G = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}` and $`k` has characteristic $`p`, then every irreducible representation of $`G` over $`k` is trivial (so $`k[\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}]` indeed is not semisimple). Indeed, an irreducible representation of this group is a 1-dimensional space on which the generator acts by a $`p`th root of unity. But every $`p`th root of unity in $`k` equals 1, as $`x^p - 1 = (x - 1)^p` over $`k`.
