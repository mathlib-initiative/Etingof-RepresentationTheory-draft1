*Theorem 4.6.3.* _A finite dimensional unitary representation $`V` of any group $`G` is completely reducible._

*Proof.* Let $`W` be a subrepresentation of $`V`. Let $`W^\perp` be the orthogonal complement of $`W` in $`V` under the Hermitian inner product. Then $`W^\perp` is a subrepresentation of $`V`, and $`V = W \oplus W^\perp`. This implies that $`V` is completely reducible. $`\square`
