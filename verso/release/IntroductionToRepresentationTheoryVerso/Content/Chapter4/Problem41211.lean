*Problem 4.12.11.* This problem is about an application of representation theory to physics (elasticity theory). We first describe the physical motivation and then state the mathematical problem.

Imagine a material which occupies a certain region $`U` in the physical space $`V = \mathbb{R}^3` (a space with a positive definite inner product). Suppose the material is deformed. This means, we have applied a diffeomorphism (= change of coordinates) $`g : U \to U'`. The question in elasticity theory is how much stress in the material this deformation will cause.

For every point $`P \in U`, let $`A_P : V \to V` be defined by $`A_P = dg(P)`. Here $`A_P` is nondegenerate, so it has a polar decomposition $`A_P = D_P O_P`, where $`O_P` is orthogonal and $`D_P` is symmetric. The matrix $`O_P` characterizes the rotation part of $`A_P` (which clearly produces no stress), and $`D_P` is the distortion part, which actually causes stress. If the deformation is small, $`D_P` is close to 1, so $`D_P = 1 + d_P`, where $`d_P` is a small symmetric matrix, i.e., an element of $`S^2V`. This matrix is called the *deformation tensor* at $`P`.

Now we define the stress tensor, which characterizes stress. Let $`v` be a small nonzero vector in $`V`, and let $`\sigma` be a small disk perpendicular to $`v` centered at $`P` of area $`||v||`. Let $`F_v` be the force with which the part of the material on the $`v`-side of $`\sigma` acts on the part on the opposite
side. It is easy to deduce from Newton's laws that $`F_v` is linear in $`v`, so there exists a linear operator $`S_P : V \to V` such that $`F_v = S_P v`. It is called *the stress tensor*.

An elasticity law is an equation $`S_P = f(d_P)`, where $`f` is a function. The simplest such law is a linear law (Hooke's law): $`f : S^2V \to \operatorname{End}(V)` is a linear function. In general, such a function is defined by $`9 \cdot 6 = 54` parameters, but we will show there are actually only two essential ones — the *compression modulus* $`K` and the *shearing modulus* $`\mu`. For this purpose we will use representation theory.

Recall that the group $`SO(3)` of rotations acts on $`V`, so $`S^2V`, $`\operatorname{End}(V)` are representations of this group. The laws of physics must be invariant under this group (Galileo transformations), so $`f` must be a homomorphism of representations.

(a) Show that $`\operatorname{End}(V)` admits a decomposition $`\mathbb{R} \oplus V \oplus W`, where $`\mathbb{R}` is the trivial representation, $`V` is the standard 3-dimensional representation, and $`W` is a 5-dimensional representation of $`SO(3)`. Show that $`S^2V = \mathbb{R} \oplus W`.

(b) Show that $`V` and $`W` are irreducible, even after complexification. Deduce using Schur's lemma that $`S_P` is always symmetric, and for $`x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in W` one has $`f(x + y) = Kx + \mu y` for some real numbers $`K, \mu`.

In fact, it is clear from physics that $`K, \mu` are positive. Physically, the compression modulus $`K` characterizes resistance of the material to compression or dilation, while the shearing modulus $`\mu` characterizes its resistance to changing the shape of the object without changing its volume. For instance, clay (used for sculpting) has a large compression modulus but a small shearing modulus.
