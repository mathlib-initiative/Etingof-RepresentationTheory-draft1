(4) The symmetric group $`S_4`. The order of $`S_4` is 24, and there are five conjugacy classes: $`e, (12), (123), (1234), (12)(34)`. Thus the sum of the squares of the dimensions of five irreducible representations is 24. As with $`S_3`, there are two of dimension 1: the trivial and sign representations, $`\mathbb{C}_+` and $`\mathbb{C}_-`. The other three must then have dimensions 2, 3, and 3. Because $`S_3 \cong S_4/\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2`, where $`\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2` is $`\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\}`, the 2-dimensional representation of $`S_3` can be pulled back to the 2-dimensional representation of $`S_4`, which we will call $`\mathbb{C}^2`.

We can consider $`S_4` as the group of rotations of a cube acting by permuting the interior diagonals (or, equivalently, on a regular octahedron permuting pairs of opposite faces); this gives the 3-dimensional representation $`\mathbb{C}^3_+`.

The last 3-dimensional representation is $`\mathbb{C}^3_-`, the product of $`\mathbb{C}^3_+` with the sign representation. $`\mathbb{C}^3_+` and $`\mathbb{C}^3_-` are different, for if $`g` is a transposition, $`\det g|_{\mathbb{C}^3_+} = 1` while $`\det g|_{\mathbb{C}^3_-} = (-1)^3 = -1`. Note
that another realization of $`\mathbb{C}^3_-` is by action of $`S_4` by symmetries (not necessarily rotations) of the regular tetrahedron. Yet another realization of this representation is the space of functions on the set of four elements (on which $`S_4` acts by permutations) with zero sum of values.
