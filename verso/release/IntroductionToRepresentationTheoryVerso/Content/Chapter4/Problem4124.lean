*Problem 4.12.4.* Recall that the adjacency matrix of a graph $`\Gamma` (without multiple edges) is the matrix in which the $`ij`th entry is 1 if the vertices $`i` and $`j` are connected with an edge, and zero otherwise. Let $`\Gamma` be a finite graph whose automorphism group is nonabelian. Show that the adjacency matrix of $`\Gamma` must have repeated eigenvalues.
