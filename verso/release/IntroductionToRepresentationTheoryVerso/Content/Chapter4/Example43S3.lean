(2) The symmetric group $`S_3`. In the symmetric group $`S_n`, conjugacy classes are determined by cycle decomposition sizes: two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same number of cycles of each length. For $`S_3`, there are three conjugacy classes, so there are three different irreducible representations over $`\mathbb{C}`. If their dimensions are $`d_1, d_2, d_3`, then $`d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 6`, so $`S_3` must have two 1-dimensional and one 2-dimensional representations. The 1-dimensional representations are the trivial representation $`\mathbb{C}_+` given by $`\rho(\sigma) = 1` and the sign representation $`\mathbb{C}_-` given by $`\rho(\sigma) = (-1)^\sigma`.

The 2-dimensional representation can be visualized as representing the symmetries of the equilateral triangle with vertices 1, 2, 3 at the points $`(\cos 120°, \sin 120°)`, $`(\cos 240°, \sin 240°)`, $`(1, 0)` of the coordinate plane, respectively. Thus, for example,

$$`\rho((12)) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \rho((123)) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos 120° & -\sin 120° \\ \sin 120° & \cos 120° \end{pmatrix}.`

To show that this representation is irreducible, consider any subrepresentation $`V`. The space $`V` must be the span of a subset of the eigenvectors of $`\rho((12))`, which are the nonzero multiples of $`(1, 0)` and $`(0, 1)`. Also, $`V` must be the span of a subset of the eigenvectors of $`\rho((123))`, which are different vectors. Thus, $`V` must be either $`\mathbb{C}^2` or $`0`.
