*Proof.* Let $`V` be irreducible. For any element $`a \in A`, the operator $`\rho(a) : V \to V` is an intertwining operator. Indeed,

$$`\rho(a)\rho(b)v = \rho(ab)v = \rho(ba)v = \rho(b)\rho(a)v`

(the second equality is true since the algebra is commutative). Thus, by Schur's lemma, $`\rho(a)` is a scalar operator for any $`a \in A`. Hence every subspace of $`V` is a subrepresentation. But $`V` is irreducible, so $`0` and $`V` are the only subspaces of $`V`. This means that $`\dim V = 1` (since $`V \neq 0`). $`\square`
