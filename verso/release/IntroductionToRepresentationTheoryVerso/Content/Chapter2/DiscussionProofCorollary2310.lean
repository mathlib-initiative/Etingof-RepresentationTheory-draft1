*Proof.* Let $`\lambda` be an eigenvalue of $`\phi` (a root of the characteristic polynomial of $`\phi`). It exists since $`k` is an algebraically closed field. Then the operator $`\phi - \lambda \operatorname{Id}` is an intertwining operator $`V \to V`, which is not an isomorphism (since its determinant is zero). Thus by Proposition 2.3.9 this operator is zero, hence the result. $`\square`
