*Problem 2.3.16.* Let $`A` be an algebra over a field $`k`. The center $`Z(A)` of $`A` is the set of all elements $`z \in A` which commute with all elements of $`A`. For example, if $`A` is commutative, then $`Z(A) = A`.

(a) Show that if $`V` is an irreducible finite dimensional representation of $`A`, then any element $`z \in Z(A)` acts in $`V` by multiplication by some scalar $`\chi_V(z)`. Show that $`\chi_V : Z(A) \to k` is a homomorphism. It is called the *central character* of $`V`.

(b) Show that if $`V` is an indecomposable finite dimensional representation of $`A`, then for any $`z \in Z(A)`, the operator $`\rho(z)` by which $`z` acts in $`V` has only one eigenvalue $`\chi_V(z)`, equal to the scalar by which $`z` acts on some irreducible subrepresentation of $`V`. Thus $`\chi_V : Z(A) \to k` is a homomorphism, which is again called the central character of $`V`.

(c) Does $`\rho(z)` in (b) have to be a scalar operator?
