*Remark 7.7.4.* The good thing about Definition 7.7.1 is that it allows us to visualize objects, morphisms, kernels, and cokernels in terms of classical algebra. But the definition also has a big drawback, which is that even if $`\mathcal{C}` is the whole category $`A`-mod, the ring $`A` is not determined by $`\mathcal{C}`. In particular, two different rings can have equivalent categories of modules (such rings are called *Morita equivalent*). Actually, it is worse than that: for many important abelian categories there is no natural (or even manageable) ring $`A` at all. This is why people prefer to use the standard definition, which is free from this drawback, even though it is more abstract.
