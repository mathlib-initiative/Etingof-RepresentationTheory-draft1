*Problem 7.8.5.* Let $`D_\bullet` be a complex of abelian groups with differentials $`d_i`, $`i \in \mathbb{Z}`, let $`C_\bullet` be a subcomplex of $`D_\bullet` (i.e. a collection of subgroups $`C_i \subset D_i` such that $`d_i(C_i) \subset C_{i+1}`), and let $`E_\bullet = D_\bullet / C_\bullet` be the quotient complex (i.e., $`E_i = D_i / C_i` with differentials induced by $`d_i`).

Define a homomorphism $`c_i : H^i(E) \to H^{i+1}(C)` as follows. Given $`x \in H^i(E)`, pick a representative $`x'` of $`x` in $`E_i`. Let $`x''` be a lift of $`x'` to $`D_i`. Let $`y' = dx'' \in D_{i+1}` (we abbreviate the notation, denoting $`d_i` just by $`d`). Since $`dx' = 0`, $`y' = dx'' \in C_{i+1}`. Also, $`dy' = d^2 x'' = 0`. So $`y'` represents an element $`y \in H^{i+1}(C)`. We will set $`c_i(x) = y`.

(i) Show that $`c_i` is well defined, i.e., $`c_i(x)` does not depend on the choice of $`x'` and $`x''`.

(ii) Show that the sequence

(7.8.1) $`\ldots H^{i-1}(E) \to H^i(C) \to H^i(D) \to H^i(E) \to H^{i+1}(C) \ldots,`

where the first map is $`c_{i-1}`, the middle two maps are induced by the maps $`C_i \to D_i \to E_i`, and the last map is $`c_i`, is exact.
