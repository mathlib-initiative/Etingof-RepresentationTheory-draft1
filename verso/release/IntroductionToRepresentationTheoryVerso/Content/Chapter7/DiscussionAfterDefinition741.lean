In particular, the above categories $`\mathcal{C}_1` and $`\mathcal{C}_2` are equivalent (check it!).

Also, the category *FSet* of finite sets is equivalent to the category whose objects are nonnegative integers, and morphisms are given by

$$`\operatorname{Hom}(m, n) = \operatorname{Maps}(\{1, \ldots, m\}, \{1, \ldots, n\}).`

Are these categories isomorphic? The answer to this question depends on whether you believe that there is only one finite set with a given number of elements, or that there are many of those. It seems better to think that there are many (without asking "how many"), so that isomorphic sets need not be literally equal, but this is really a matter of choice. In any case, this is not really a reasonable question; the answer to this question is irrelevant for any practical purpose, and thinking about it will give you nothing but a headache.
