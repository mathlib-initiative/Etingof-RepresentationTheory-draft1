A fundamental notion in category theory is that of a *representable functor*. Namely, let $`\mathcal{C}` be a (locally small) category, and let $`F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Sets}` be a functor. We say that $`F` is *representable* if there exists an object $`X \in \mathcal{C}` such that $`F` is isomorphic to the functor $`\operatorname{Hom}(X, ?)`. More precisely, if we are given such an object $`X`, together with an isomorphism $`\xi : F \cong \operatorname{Hom}(X, ?)`, we say that the functor $`F` is *represented by* $`X` (using $`\xi`).

In a similar way, one can talk about representable functors from $`\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}` to *Sets*. Namely, one calls such a functor representable if it is of the form $`\operatorname{Hom}(?, X)` for some object $`X \in \mathcal{C}`, up to an isomorphism.

Not every functor is representable, but if a representing object $`X` exists, then it is unique. Namely, we have the following lemma.
