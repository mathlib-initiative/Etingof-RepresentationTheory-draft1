*Lemma 7.5.1* (The Yoneda Lemma). _If a functor $`F` is represented by an object $`X`, then $`X` is unique up to a unique isomorphism. I.e., if $`X, Y` are two objects in $`\mathcal{C}`, then for any isomorphism of functors_
$`\phi : \operatorname{Hom}(X, ?) \to \operatorname{Hom}(Y, ?)` _there is a unique isomorphism $`a_\phi : X \to Y` inducing $`\phi`._

*Proof (Sketch).* One sets $`a_\phi = \phi_Y^{-1}(1_Y)` and shows that it is invertible by constructing the inverse, which is $`a_\phi^{-1} = \phi_X(1_X)`. It remains to show that the composition both ways is the identity, which we will omit here. This establishes the existence of $`a_\phi`. Its uniqueness is verified in a straightforward manner. $`\square`
