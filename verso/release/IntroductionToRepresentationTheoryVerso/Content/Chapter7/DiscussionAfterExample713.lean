*Important remark.* Unfortunately, one cannot simplify this definition by replacing the word "class" by the much more familiar word "set". Indeed, this would rule out the important Example 7.1.3(1), as it is well known that there is _no_ set of all sets and that working with such a set leads to contradictions. The precise definition of a class and the precise distinction between a class and a set is the subject of set theory and cannot be discussed here. Luckily, for most practical purposes (in particular, in these notes) this distinction is not essential.

We also mention that in many examples, including Examples 7.1.3(1)-(6), the word "class" in part (ii) of Definition 7.1.1 can be replaced by "set". Categories with this property (that $`\operatorname{Hom}(X, Y)` is a set for any $`X, Y`) are called *locally small*; many categories that we encounter are of this kind.
