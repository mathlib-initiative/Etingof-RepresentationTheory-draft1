*Proposition 6.6.6.* _Let $`Q` be a quiver, and let $`V` be a representation of $`Q`._

_(1) If_

$$`
\varphi : \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \to V_i
`

_is surjective, then_

$$`
F_i^- F_i^+ V = V.
`

_(2) If_

$$`
\psi : V_i \to \bigoplus_{i \to j} V_j
`

_is injective, then_

$$`
F_i^+ F_i^- V = V.
`

*Proof.* In the following proof, by $`i \to j` we will always mean that $`i` points into $`j` in the original quiver $`Q`. We only establish the first statement and we also restrict ourselves to showing that the spaces of $`V` and $`F_i^- F_i^+ V` are the same. It is enough to do so for the $`i`th space. Let

$$`
\varphi : \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \to V_i
`

be surjective and let

$$`
K = \ker \varphi.
`
When applying $`F_i^+`, the space $`V_i` gets replaced by $`K`. Furthermore, let

$$`
\psi : K \to \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j.
`

After applying $`F_i^-`, $`K` gets replaced by

$$`
K' = \left( \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \right) / (\operatorname{Im} \psi).
`

But

$$`
\operatorname{Im} \psi = K
`

and therefore

$$`
K' = \left( \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \right) / \left( \ker(\varphi : \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \to V_i) \right) = \operatorname{Im}(\varphi : \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \to V_i)
`

by the homomorphism theorem. Since $`\varphi` was assumed to be surjective, we get

$$`
K' = V_i.
`

$`\square`
