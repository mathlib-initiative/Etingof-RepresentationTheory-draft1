In this problem you will prove the "only if" direction of this theorem (i.e., why other quivers are NOT of finite type).

(a) Suppose $`Q` has $`n` vertices and no self-loops. Show that for any rational numbers $`x_i`, $`1 \leq i \leq n`, which are not simultaneously zero, one has $`q(x_1, \ldots, x_n) > 0`, where

$$`q(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \sum_{i \in D} x_i^2 - \sum_{i,j \in D} b_{ij} x_i x_j.`

Hint: It suffices to check the result for integers: $`x_i = m_i`. First assume that $`m_i \geq 0`, and consider the space $`W` of representations $`V` of $`Q` such that $`\dim V_i = m_i`. Show that the group $`\prod_i GL_{m_i}(k)` acts with finitely many orbits on $`W \oplus k`, and use Problem 6.1.2 to derive the inequality. Then deduce the result in the case when $`m_i` are arbitrary integers.

(b) Deduce that $`q` is a positive definite quadratic form.

Hint: Use the fact that $`\mathbb{Q}` is dense in $`\mathbb{R}`.

(c) Show that a quiver of finite type can have no self-loops. Then, using Problem 6.1.3, deduce the theorem.
