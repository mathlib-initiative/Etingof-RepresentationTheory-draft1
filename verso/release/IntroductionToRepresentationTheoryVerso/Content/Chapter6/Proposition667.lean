*Proposition 6.6.7.* _Let $`Q` be a quiver, and let $`V` be an indecomposable representation of $`Q`. Then $`F_i^+ V` and $`F_i^- V` (whenever defined) are either indecomposable or $`0`._

*Proof.* We prove the proposition for $`F_i^+ V`; the case $`F_i^- V` follows similarly. By Proposition 6.6.5 it follows that either

$$`
\varphi : \bigoplus_{j \to i} V_j \to V_i
`

is surjective or $`\dim V_i = 1`, $`\dim V_j = 0`, $`j \neq i`. In the last case

$$`
F_i^+ V = 0.
`

So we can assume that $`\varphi` is surjective. In this case, assume that $`F_i^+ V` is decomposable as

$$`
F_i^+ V = X \oplus Y
`
with $`X, Y \neq 0`. But $`F_i^+ V` is injective at $`i`, since the maps are canonical projections, whose direct sum is the tautological embedding. Therefore $`X` and $`Y` also have to be injective at $`i` and hence (by Proposition 6.6.6)

$$`
F_i^+ F_i^- X = X, \quad F_i^+ F_i^- Y = Y.
`

In particular

$$`
F_i^- X \neq 0, \quad F_i^- Y \neq 0.
`

Therefore

$$`
V = F_i^- F_i^+ V = F_i^- X \oplus F_i^- Y,
`

which is a contradiction, since $`V` was assumed to be indecomposable. So we can infer that

$$`
F_i^+ V
`

is indecomposable. $`\square`
