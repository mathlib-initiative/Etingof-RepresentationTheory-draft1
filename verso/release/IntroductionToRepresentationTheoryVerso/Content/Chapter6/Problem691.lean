*Problem 6.9.1.* Let $`Q_n` be the *cyclic quiver* of length $`n`, i.e., $`n` vertices connected by $`n` oriented edges forming a cycle. Obviously, the classification of indecomposable representations of $`Q_1` is given by the Jordan normal form theorem. Obtain a similar classification of indecomposable representations of $`Q_2`. In other words, classify pairs of linear operators $`A : V \to W` and $`B : W \to V` up to isomorphism. Namely:

(a) Consider the following pairs (for $`n \geq 1`):

(1) $`E_{n,\lambda}`: $`V = W = \mathbb{C}^n`, $`A` is the Jordan block of size $`n` with eigenvalue $`\lambda`, $`B = 1` ($`\lambda \in \mathbb{C}`).

(2) $`E_{n,\infty}`: is obtained from $`E_{n,0}` by exchanging $`V` with $`W` and $`A` with $`B`.

(3) $`H_n`: $`V = \mathbb{C}^n` with basis $`v_i`, $`W = \mathbb{C}^{n-1}` with basis $`w_i`, $`Av_i = w_i`, $`Bw_i = v_{i+1}` for $`i < n`, and $`Av_n = 0`.

(4) $`K_n` is obtained from $`H_n` by exchanging $`V` with $`W` and $`A` with $`B`.

Show that these are indecomposable and pairwise nonisomorphic.

(b) Show that if $`E` is a representation of $`Q_2` such that $`AB` is not nilpotent, then $`E = E' \oplus E''`, where $`E'' = E_{n,\lambda}` for some $`\lambda \neq 0`.

(c) Consider the case when $`AB` is nilpotent, and consider the operator $`X` on $`V \oplus W` given by $`X(v, w) = (Bw, Av)`. Show that $`X` is nilpotent and admits a basis consisting of chains (i.e., sequences $`u, Xu, X^2 u, \ldots X^{l-1} u` where $`X^l u = 0`) which are compatible with the direct sum decomposition (i.e., for every chain $`u \in V` or $`u \in W`). Deduce that (1)—(4) are the only indecomposable representations of $`Q_2`.

(d) (Harder!) Generalize this classification to the Kronecker quiver, which has two vertices 1 and 2 and two edges both going from 1 to 2.

(e) (Still harder!) Can you generalize this classification to $`Q_n`, $`n > 2` with any orientation? (Easier version: consider only the cyclic orientation).
