## 6.8. Proof of Gabriel's theorem
%%%
tag := "Chapter6/Section6.8_heading/heading-1"
%%%

Let $`V` be an indecomposable representation of $`Q`. We introduce a fixed labeling $`1, \ldots, n` on $`Q`, such that $`i < j` if one can reach $`j` from $`i`. This is possible, since we can assign the highest label to any sink, remove this sink from the quiver, assign the next highest label to a sink of the remaining quiver, and so on. This way we create a labeling of the desired kind.

We now consider the sequence

$$`V^{(0)} = V, \quad V^{(1)} = F_n^+ V, \quad V^{(2)} = F_{n-1}^+ F_n^+ V, \quad \ldots.`

This sequence is well defined because of the selected labeling: $`n` has to be a sink of $`Q`, $`n-1` has to be a sink of $`\overline{Q}_n` (where $`\overline{Q}_r` is obtained from $`Q` by reversing all the arrows at the vertex $`r`) and so on. Furthermore, we note that $`V^{(n)}` is a representation of $`Q` again, since every arrow has been reversed twice (since we applied a reflection functor to every vertex). This implies that we can define

$$`V^{(n+1)} = F_n^+ V^{(n)}, \ldots`

and continue the sequence to infinity.
