*Proposition 9.1.1.* Let $`e_0 \in A/I` be an idempotent, i.e., $`e_0^2 = e_0`. There exists an idempotent $`e \in A` which is a lift of $`e_0` (i.e., it projects to $`e_0` under the reduction modulo $`I`). This idempotent is unique up to conjugation by an element of $`1 + I`.

*Proof.* Let us first establish the statement in the case when $`I^2 = 0`. Note that in this case $`I` is a left and right module over $`A/I`. Let $`e_*` be any lift of $`e_0` to $`A`. Then $`e_*^2 - e_* = a \in I`, and $`e_0 a = a e_0`. We look for $`e` in the form $`e = e_* + b`, $`b \in I`. The equation for $`b` is

$$`
e_0 b + b e_0 - b = -a.
`

Set $`b = (1 - 2e_0)a`. Then

$$`
e_0 b + b e_0 - b = -2e_0 a - (1 - 2e_0)a = -a,
`

so $`e` is an idempotent. To classify other solutions, set $`e' = e + c`. For $`e'` to be an idempotent, we must have $`ec + ce - c = 0`. This is equivalent to saying that $`ece = 0` and $`(1 - e)c(1 - e) = 0`, so $`c = ec(1 - e) + (1 - e)ce = [e, [e, c]]`. Hence $`e' = (1 + [c, e])e(1 + [c, e])^{-1}`.

Now, in the general case, we prove by induction in $`k` that there exists a lift $`e_k` of $`e_{k-1}` to $`A/I^{k+1}`, and it is unique up to conjugation by an element of $`1 + I^k` (this is sufficient as $`I` is nilpotent). Assume it is true for $`k = m - 1`, and let us prove it for $`k = m`. So we have an idempotent $`e_{m-1} \in A/I^m`, and we have to lift it to $`A/I^{m+1}`. But $`(I^m)^2 = 0` in $`A/I^{m+1}`, so we are done. $`\square`
