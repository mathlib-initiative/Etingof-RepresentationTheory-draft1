*Problem 4.12.7.* Let $`G = SU(2)` (the group of unitary $`2 \times 2` matrices with determinant 1), and let $`V = \mathbb{C}^2` be the standard 2-dimensional representation of $`SU(2)`. We regard $`V` as a real representation, so it is 4-dimensional.

(a) Show that $`V` is irreducible (as a real representation).

(b) Let $`\mathbb{H}` be the subspace of $`\operatorname{End}_{\mathbb{R}}(V)` consisting of endomorphisms of $`V` as a real representation. Show that $`\mathbb{H}` is 4-dimensional and closed under multiplication. Show that every nonzero element in $`\mathbb{H}` is invertible, i.e., $`\mathbb{H}` is an algebra with division.

(c) Find a basis $`1, i, j, k` of $`\mathbb{H}` such that $`1` is the unit and

$$`i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad ij = -ji = k, \quad jk = -kj = i, \quad ki = -ik = j.`

Thus we have that $`Q_8` is a subgroup of the group $`\mathbb{H}^{\times}` of invertible elements of $`\mathbb{H}` under multiplication.

The algebra $`\mathbb{H}` is called the *quaternion algebra*, and its elements are called *quaternions*. Quaternions were discovered by W. R. Hamilton in 1843 (see Section 4.13).

(d) For $`q = a + bi + cj + dk`, $`a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}`, let $`\bar{q} = a - bi - cj - dk` and $`||q||^2 = q\bar{q} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2`. Show that $`\overline{q_1 q_2} = \bar{q}_2 \bar{q}_1` and $`||q_1 q_2|| = ||q_1|| \cdot ||q_2||`.
(e) Let $`G` be the group of quaternions of norm 1. Show that this group is isomorphic to $`SU(2)`. (Thus geometrically $`SU(2)` is the 3-dimensional sphere.)

(f) Consider the action of $`G` on the space $`V \subset \mathbb{H}` spanned by $`i, j, k`, by $`x \to qxq^{-1}`, $`q \in G`, $`x \in V`. Since this action preserves the norm on $`V`, we have a homomorphism $`h : SU(2) \to SO(3)`, where $`SO(3)` is the group of rotations of the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Show that this homomorphism is surjective and that its kernel is $`\{1, -1\}`.
