*Proposition 4.7.1.* _(i) Matrix elements of nonisomorphic irreducible representations are orthogonal in $`F(G, \mathbb{C})` under the form $`(f, g) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} f(x)\overline{g(x)}`._

_(ii) One has $`(t^V_{ij}, t^V_{i'j'}) = \delta_{ii'}\delta_{jj'} \cdot \frac{1}{\dim V}`._

_Thus, matrix elements of irreducible representations of $`G` form an orthogonal basis of $`F(G, \mathbb{C})`._

*Proof.* Let $`V` and $`W` be two irreducible representations of $`G`. Take $`\{v_i\}` to be an orthonormal basis of $`V` and $`\{w_i\}` to be an orthonormal basis of $`W` under their positive definite invariant Hermitian forms. Let $`w^*_i \in W^*` be the linear function on $`W` defined by taking the inner product with $`w_i`: $`w^*_i(u) = (u, w_i)`. Then for $`x \in G` we have
$`(xw^*_i, w^*_j) = \overline{(xw_i, w_j)}`. Therefore, putting $`P = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} x`, we have

$$`(t^V_{ij}, t^W_{i'j'}) = |G|^{-1} \sum_{x \in G} (xv_i, v_j)\overline{(xw_{i'}, w_{j'})}`

$$`= |G|^{-1} \sum_{x \in G} (xv_i, v_j)(xw^*_{i'}, w^*_{j'}) = (P(v_i \otimes w^*_{i'}), v_j \otimes w^*_{j'}).`

If $`V \neq W`, this is zero, since $`P` projects to the trivial representation, which does not occur in $`V \otimes W^*`. If $`V = W`, we need to consider $`(P(v_i \otimes v^*_{i'}), v_j \otimes v^*_{j'})`. We have a $`G`-invariant decomposition

$$`V \otimes V^* = \mathbb{C} \oplus L,`

$$`\mathbb{C} = \operatorname{span}(\sum v_k \otimes v^*_k),`

$$`L = \operatorname{span}_{a: \sum_k a_{kk} = 0}(\sum_{k,l} a_{kl} v_k \otimes v^*_l),`

and $`P` projects to the first summand along the second one. The projection of $`v_i \otimes v^*_{i'}` to $`\mathbb{C} \subset \mathbb{C} \oplus L` is thus

$$`\frac{\delta_{ii'}}{\dim V} \sum v_k \otimes v^*_k.`

This shows that

$$`(P(v_i \otimes v^*_{i'}), v_j \otimes v^*_{j'}) = \frac{\delta_{ii'}\delta_{jj'}}{\dim V},`

which finishes the proof of (i) and (ii). The last statement follows immediately from the sum of squares formula. $`\square`
