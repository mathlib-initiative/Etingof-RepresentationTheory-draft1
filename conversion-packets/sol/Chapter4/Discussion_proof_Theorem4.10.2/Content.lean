Now we are ready to proceed to the proof of Theorem 4.10.2.

*Proof.* Let $`V = \mathbb{C}[G]` be the regular representation of $`G`. Consider the operator-valued polynomial

$$`L(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{g \in G} x_g \rho(g),`
where $`\rho(g) \in \mathrm{End}\, V` is induced by $`g`. The action of $`L(\mathbf{x})` on an element $`h \in G` is

$$`L(\mathbf{x})h = \sum_{g \in G} x_g \rho(g) h = \sum_{g \in G} x_g g h = \sum_{z \in G} x_{zh^{-1}} z.`

So the matrix of the linear operator $`L(\mathbf{x})` in the basis $`g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n` is $`X_G` with permuted columns and hence has the same determinant up to sign.

Further, by Maschke's theorem, we have

$$`\det_V L(\mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i=1}^{r} (\det_{V_i} L(\mathbf{x}))^{\dim V_i},`

where $`V_i` are the irreducible representations of $`G`. We set $`P_i = \det_{V_i} L(\mathbf{x})`. Let $`\{e_{im}\}` be bases of $`V_i` and let $`E_{i,jk} \in \mathrm{End}\, V_i` be the matrix units in these bases. Then $`\{E_{i,jk}\}` is a basis of $`\mathbb{C}[G]` and

$$`L(\mathbf{x})|_{V_i} = \sum_{j,k} y_{i,jk} E_{i,jk},`

where $`y_{i,jk}` are new coordinates on $`\mathbb{C}[G]` related to $`x_g` by a linear transformation. Then

$$`P_i(\mathbf{x}) = \det|_{V_i} L(\mathbf{x}) = \det(y_{i,jk}).`

Hence, $`P_i` are irreducible (by Lemma 4.10.3) and not proportional to each other (as they depend on different collections of variables $`y_{i,jk}`). The theorem is proved. $`\square`
