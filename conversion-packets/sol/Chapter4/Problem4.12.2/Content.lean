*Problem 4.12.2.* Let $`p` be a prime. Let $`G` be the group of $`3 \times 3` matrices over $`\mathbb{F}_p` which are upper triangular and have 1's on the diagonal, under multiplication (its order is $`p^3`). It is called the *Heisenberg group*. For any complex number $`z` such that $`z^p = 1`, we define a representation of $`G` on the space $`V` of complex functions on $`\mathbb{F}_p` by

$$`(\rho \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} f)(x) = f(x - 1),`
$$`(\rho \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} f)(x) = z^x f(x)`

(note that $`z^x` makes sense since $`z^p = 1`).

(a) Show that such a representation exists and is unique, and compute $`\rho(g)` for all $`g \in G`.

(b) Denote this representation by $`R_z`. Show that $`R_z` is irreducible if and only if $`z \neq 1`.

(c) Classify all 1-dimensional representations of $`G`. Show that $`R_1` decomposes into a direct sum of 1-dimensional representations, where each of them occurs exactly once.

(d) Use (a)—(c) and the "sum of squares" formula to classify all irreducible representations of $`G`.
