*Corollary 6.8.4.* _For every positive root $`\alpha`, there is an indecomposable representation $`V` with_

$$`
d(V) = \alpha.
`

*Proof.* Consider the sequence

$$`
s_n \alpha, s_{n-1} s_n \alpha, \ldots.
`

Consider the first element of this sequence which is a negative root (this has to happen by Lemma 6.7.2) and look at one step before that, calling this element $`\beta`. So $`\beta` is a positive root and $`s_i \beta` is a negative root for some $`i`. But since the $`s_i` only change one coordinate, we get

$$`
\beta = \alpha_i
`

and

$$`
(s_q \ldots s_{n-1} s_n) \alpha = \alpha_i.
`

Let $`Q'` be the quiver $`Q` with orientation modified by the element $`s_q \ldots s_{n-1} s_n`. We let $`k_{(i)}` be the representation of $`Q'` having dimension vector $`\alpha_i`. Then we define

$$`
V = F_n^- F_{n-1}^- \ldots F_q^- k_{(i)}.
`

This is an indecomposable representation of $`Q` and

$$`
d(V) = \alpha.
`

$`\square`
