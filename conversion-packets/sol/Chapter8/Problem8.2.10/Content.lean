*Problem 8.2.10.* Let $`V` be a finite dimensional vector space over a field $`k`. Let $`C_i = SV \otimes \wedge^i V`. We can view $`C_i` as the space of polynomial functions on $`V^*` with values in $`\wedge^i V`. Define the differential $`d_i : C_i \to C_{i-1}` by the formula

$$`
d_i(f)(u) = \iota_u f(u), \quad u \in V^*,
`

where $`\iota_u : \wedge^i V \to \wedge^{i-1} V` is the contraction defined by the formula

$$`
\iota_u(v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{i} (-1)^j u(v_j) v_1 \wedge \ldots \hat{v}_j \cdots \wedge v_i.
`

(i) Show that $`C_\bullet` is a projective (in fact, free) resolution of $`k` (with trivial action of $`V`) as an $`SV`-module. (It is called the *Koszul resolution*.)

(ii) Let $`V = U \oplus W`. Then we can view $`SW` as an $`SV`-module ($`U` acts by zero). Construct a resolution of $`SW` by free $`SV`-modules whose terms are $`C_i = SV \otimes \wedge^i U`.

Hint: Tensor the Koszul resolution of $`k` as an $`SU`-module by $`SW`.

(iii) Regard $`SV` as an $`S(V \oplus V) = SV \otimes SV`-module using left and right multiplication. Construct a free resolution of $`SV` as an $`SV \otimes SV`-module with terms $`C_i = SV \otimes \wedge^i V \otimes SV` (called the Koszul bimodule resolution).

(iv) By tensoring the resolution of (iii) over $`SV` with any $`SV`-module $`M`, construct a projective (in fact, free) resolution $`P_\bullet` of $`M` with $`P_i = 0` for $`i > \dim V`. Deduce that for any $`SV`-module $`N` and any $`i > \dim V`, one has

$$`
\mathrm{Tor}_i^{SV}(M, N) = \mathrm{Ext}^i_{SV}(M, N) = 0
`

(the *Hilbert syzygies theorem*).

(v) Compute $`\mathrm{Ext}^i_{SV}(k, k)` and $`\mathrm{Tor}_i^{SV}(k, k)`.
