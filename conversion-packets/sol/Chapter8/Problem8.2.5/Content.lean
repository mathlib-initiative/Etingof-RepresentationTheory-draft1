*Problem 8.2.5.* In this problem we will show that the cohomology groups $`\mathrm{Tor}_i` and $`\mathrm{Ext}^i` don't really depend on the projective resolution $`P_\bullet`, in a fairly strong sense, which justifies the fact that we don't mention $`P_\bullet` in the notation for them.

Let $`P_\bullet`, $`Q_\bullet` be two projective resolutions of $`M`. Let $`d^P_i : P_i \to P_{i-1}`, $`d^Q_i : Q_i \to Q_{i-1}` be the corresponding differentials; in particular, $`d^P_0 : P_0 \to M`, $`d^Q_0 : Q_0 \to M`.

(i) Show that there exists a homomorphism $`f_0 : P_0 \to Q_0` such that $`d^Q_0 \circ f_0 = d^P_0`.

(ii) Proceed to show by induction in $`j` that there exists a homomorphism $`f_j : P_j \to Q_j` such that $`d^Q_j \circ f_j = f_{j-1} \circ d^P_j`.

The collection of homomorphisms satisfying the conditions of (i) and (ii) is called a *morphism of resolutions*, $`f : P_\bullet \to Q_\bullet`.

(iii) Clearly, such a morphism $`f` defines a linear map $`\psi_i(P, Q, f) : \mathrm{Tor}_i^P(M, N) \to \mathrm{Tor}_i^Q(M, N)`, where the superscripts $`P` and $`Q` mean that the Tor groups are defined using the resolutions $`P_\bullet` and $`Q_\bullet`. Show that the maps $`\psi_i(P, Q, f)` don't really depend on $`f` (so they can be denoted by $`\psi_i(P, Q)`).

(iv) Deduce that $`\psi_i(P, Q)` are isomorphisms (use that $`\psi_i(P, P) = \mathrm{id}` and $`\psi_i(Q, R) \circ \psi_i(P, Q) = \psi_i(P, R)`).

(v) Define similar maps $`\xi_i(Q, P, f) : \mathrm{Ext}^i_P(M, N) \to \mathrm{Ext}^i_Q(M, N)` and show that they are independent on $`f` and are isomorphisms.
