*Problem 2.15.1.* According to the above, a representation of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` is just a vector space $`V` with a triple of operators $`E, F, H` such that $`HE - EH = 2E`, $`HF - FH = -2F`, $`EF - FE = H` (the corresponding map $`\rho` is given by $`\rho(e) = E`, $`\rho(f) = F`, $`\rho(h) = H`).
Let $`V` be a finite dimensional representation of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` (the ground field in this problem is $`\mathbb{C}`).

(a) Take eigenvalues of $`H` and pick one with the biggest real part. Call it $`\lambda`. Let $`\bar{V}(\lambda)` be the generalized eigenspace corresponding to $`\lambda`. Show that $`E|_{\bar{V}(\lambda)} = 0`.

(b) Let $`W` be any representation of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` and let $`w \in W` be a nonzero vector such that $`Ew = 0`. For any $`k > 0` find a polynomial $`P_k(x)` of degree $`k` such that $`E^k F^k w = P_k(H)w`. (First compute $`EF^k w`; then use induction in $`k`.)

(c) Let $`v \in \bar{V}(\lambda)` be a generalized eigenvector of $`H` with eigenvalue $`\lambda`. Show that there exists $`N > 0` such that $`F^N v = 0`.

(d) Show that $`H` is diagonalizable on $`\bar{V}(\lambda)`. (Take $`N` to be such that $`F^N = 0` on $`\bar{V}(\lambda)`, and compute $`E^N F^N v`, $`v \in \bar{V}(\lambda)`, by (b). Use the fact that $`P_k(x)` does not have multiple roots.)

(e) Let $`N_v` be the smallest $`N` satisfying (c). Show that $`\lambda = N_v - 1`.

(f) Show that for each $`N > 0`, there exists a unique up to isomorphism irreducible representation of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` of dimension $`N`. Compute the matrices $`E, F, H` in this representation using a convenient basis. (For $`V` finite dimensional irreducible take $`\lambda` as in (a) and $`v \in V(\lambda)` an eigenvector of $`H`. Show that $`v, Fv, \ldots, F^\lambda v` is a basis of $`V`, and compute the matrices of the operators $`E, F, H` in this basis.)

Denote the $`(\lambda + 1)`-dimensional irreducible representation from (f) by $`V_\lambda`. Below you will show that any finite dimensional representation is a direct sum of $`V_\lambda`.

(g) Show that the operator $`C = EF + FE + H^2/2` (the so-called *Casimir operator*) commutes with $`E, F, H` and equals $`\frac{\lambda(\lambda+2)}{2} \operatorname{Id}` on $`V_\lambda`.

Now it is easy to prove the direct sum decomposition. Namely, assume the contrary, and let $`V` be a reducible representation of the smallest dimension, which is not a direct sum of smaller representations.

(h) Show that $`C` has only one eigenvalue on $`V`, namely $`\frac{\lambda(\lambda+2)}{2}` for some nonnegative integer $`\lambda` (use the fact that the generalized
eigenspace decomposition of $`C` must be a decomposition of representations).

(i) Show that $`V` has a subrepresentation $`W = V_\lambda` such that $`V/W = nV_\lambda` for some $`n` (use (h) and the fact that $`V` is the smallest reducible representation which cannot be decomposed).

(j) Deduce from (i) that the eigenspace $`V(\lambda)` of $`H` is $`(n+1)`-dimensional. If $`v_1, \ldots, v_{n+1}` is its basis, show that $`F^j v_i`, $`1 \leq i \leq n+1`, $`0 \leq j \leq \lambda`, are linearly independent and therefore form a basis of $`V` (establish that if $`Fx = 0` and $`Hx = \mu x` for $`x \neq 0`, then $`Cx = \frac{\mu(\mu-2)}{2} x` and hence $`\mu = -\lambda`).

(k) Define $`W_i = \operatorname{span}(v_i, Fv_i, \ldots, F^\lambda v_i)`. Show that $`W_i` are subrepresentations of $`V` and derive a contradiction to the fact that $`V` cannot be decomposed.

(l) (Jacobson-Morozov lemma) Let $`V` be a finite dimensional complex vector space and $`A : V \to V` a nilpotent operator. Show that there exists a unique, up to an isomorphism, representation of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` on $`V` such that $`E = A`. (Use the classification of the representations and the Jordan normal form theorem.)

(m) (Clebsch-Gordan decomposition) Find the decomposition of the representation $`V_\lambda \otimes V_\mu` of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` into irreducible components.

Hint: For a finite dimensional representation $`V` of $`\mathfrak{sl}(2)` it is useful to introduce the character $`\chi_V(x) = Tr(e^{xH})`, $`x \in \mathbb{C}`. Show that $`\chi_{V \oplus W}(x) = \chi_V(x) + \chi_W(x)` and $`\chi_{V \otimes W}(x) = \chi_V(x)\chi_W(x)`. Then compute the character of $`V_\lambda` and of $`V_\lambda \otimes V_\mu` and derive the decomposition. This decomposition is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics.

(n) Let $`V = \mathbb{C}^M \otimes \mathbb{C}^N` and $`A = J_{0,M} \otimes \operatorname{Id}_N + \operatorname{Id}_M \otimes J_{0,N}`, where $`J_{0,n}` is the Jordan block of size $`n` with eigenvalue zero (i.e., $`J_{0,n} e_i = e_{i-1}`, $`i = 2, \ldots, n`, and $`J_{0,n} e_1 = 0`). Find the Jordan normal form of $`A` using (l) and (m).
