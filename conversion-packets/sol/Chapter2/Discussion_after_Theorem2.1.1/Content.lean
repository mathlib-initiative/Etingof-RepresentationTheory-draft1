As another example consider the representation theory of quivers. A *quiver* is an oriented graph $`Q` (which we will assume to be finite). A *representation* of $`Q` over a field $`k` is an assignment of a $`k`-vector space $`V_i` to every vertex $`i` of $`Q` and of a linear operator $`A_h : V_i \to V_j` to every directed edge $`h` going from $`i` to $`j` (loops and multiple edges are allowed). We will show that a representation of a quiver $`Q` is the same thing as a representation of a certain algebra $`P_Q` called the path algebra of $`Q`. Thus one may ask: what are the indecomposable finite dimensional representations of $`Q`?

More specifically, let us say that $`Q` is *of finite type* if it has finitely many indecomposable representations.
