*Problem 2.13.1.* It is known that if $`A` and $`B` are two polygons of the same area, then $`A` can be cut by finitely many straight cuts into pieces from which one can make $`B` (check it — it is fun!). David Hilbert asked in 1900 whether it is true for polyhedra in three dimensions. In particular, is it true for a cube and a regular tetrahedron of the same volume?

The answer is "no", as was found by Dehn in 1901. The proof is very beautiful. Namely, to any polyhedron $`A`, let us attach its "Dehn invariant" $`D(A)` in $`V = \mathbb{R} \otimes (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q})` (the tensor product of $`\mathbb{Q}`-vector spaces). Namely,

$$`D(A) = \sum_a l(a) \otimes \frac{\beta(a)}{\pi},`

where $`a` runs over edges of $`A` and $`l(a), \beta(a)` are the length of $`a` and the dihedral angle at $`a`.
(a) Show that if you cut $`A` into $`B` and $`C` by a straight cut, then $`D(A) = D(B) + D(C)`.

(b) Show that $`\alpha = \arccos(1/3)/\pi` is not a rational number.

Hint: Assume that $`\alpha = 2m/n`, for integers $`m, n`. Deduce that roots of the equation $`x + x^{-1} = 2/3` are roots of unity of degree $`n`. Then show that $`x^k + x^{-k}` has denominator $`3^k` and get a contradiction.

(c) Using (a) and (b), show that the answer to Hilbert's question is negative. (Compute the Dehn invariant of the regular tetrahedron and the cube.)
