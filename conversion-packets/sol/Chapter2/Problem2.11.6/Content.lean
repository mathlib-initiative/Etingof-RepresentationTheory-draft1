*Problem 2.11.6.* Throughout this problem, we let $`k` be an arbitrary field (not necessarily of characteristic zero and not necessarily algebraically closed).

If $`A` and $`B` are two $`k`-algebras, then an $`(A, B)`*-bimodule* will mean a $`k`-vector space $`V` with both a left $`A`-module structure and a right $`B`-module structure which satisfy $`(av) b = a (vb)` for any $`v \in V`, $`a \in A`, and $`b \in B`. Note that both the notions of "left $`A`-module" and "right $`A`-module" are particular cases of the notion of bimodules; namely, a left $`A`-module is the same as an $`(A, k)`-bimodule, and a right $`A`-module is the same as a $`(k, A)`-bimodule.

Let $`B` be a $`k`-algebra, $`W` a left $`B`-module, and $`V` a right $`B`-module. We denote by $`V \otimes_B W` the $`k`-vector space $`(V \otimes_k W) / \langle vb \otimes w - v \otimes bw \mid v \in V, w \in W, b \in B \rangle`. We denote the projection of a pure tensor $`v \otimes w` (with $`v \in V` and $`w \in W`) onto the space $`V \otimes_B W` by $`v \otimes_B w`. (Note that this tensor product $`V \otimes_B W` is the one defined in Remark 2.11.4.)

If, additionally, $`A` is another $`k`-algebra and if the right $`B`-module structure on $`V` is part of an $`(A, B)`-bimodule structure, then $`V \otimes_B W` becomes a left $`A`-module by $`a (v \otimes_B w) = av \otimes_B w` for any $`a \in A`, $`v \in V`, and $`w \in W`.

Similarly, if $`C` is another $`k`-algebra, and if the left $`B`-module structure on $`W` is part of a $`(B, C)`-bimodule structure, then $`V \otimes_B W` becomes a right $`C`-module by $`(v \otimes_B w) c = v \otimes_B wc` for any $`c \in C`, $`v \in V`, and $`w \in W`.
If $`V` is an $`(A, B)`-bimodule and $`W` is a $`(B, C)`-bimodule, then these two structures on $`V \otimes_B W` can be combined into one $`(A, C)`-bimodule structure on $`V \otimes_B W`.

(a) Let $`A`, $`B`, $`C`, $`D` be four algebras. Let $`V` be an $`(A, B)`-bimodule, $`W` a $`(B, C)`-bimodule, and $`X` a $`(C, D)`-bimodule. Prove that $`(V \otimes_B W) \otimes_C X \cong V \otimes_B (W \otimes_C X)` as $`(A, D)`-bimodules. The isomorphism (from left to right) is given by the formula

$$`
(v \otimes_B w) \otimes_C x \mapsto v \otimes_B (w \otimes_C x)
`

for all $`v \in V`, $`w \in W`, and $`x \in X`.

(b) If $`A`, $`B`, $`C` are three algebras and if $`V` is an $`(A, B)`-bimodule and $`W` an $`(A, C)`-bimodule, then the vector space $`\operatorname{Hom}_A(V, W)` (the space of all left $`A`-linear homomorphisms from $`V` to $`W`) canonically becomes a $`(B, C)`-bimodule by setting $`(bf)(v) = f(vb)` for all $`b \in B`, $`f \in \operatorname{Hom}_A(V, W)`, and $`v \in V` and setting $`(fc)(v) = f(v) c` for all $`c \in C`, $`f \in \operatorname{Hom}_A(V, W)` and $`v \in V`.

Let $`A`, $`B`, $`C`, $`D` be four algebras. Let $`V` be a $`(B, A)`-bimodule, $`W` a $`(C, B)`-bimodule, and $`X` a $`(C, D)`-bimodule. Prove that

$$`
\operatorname{Hom}_B(V, \operatorname{Hom}_C(W, X)) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_C(W \otimes_B V, X)
`

as $`(A, D)`-bimodules. The isomorphism (from left to right) is given by

$$`
f \mapsto (w \otimes_B v \mapsto f(v) w)
`

for all $`v \in V`, $`w \in W` and $`f \in \operatorname{Hom}_B(V, \operatorname{Hom}_C(W, X))`.
