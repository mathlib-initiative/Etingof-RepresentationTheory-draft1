*Problem 2.3.18.* Prove the following "infinite dimensional Schur lemma" (due to Dixmier): Let $`A` be an algebra over $`\mathbb{C}` and let $`V` be an irreducible representation of $`A` with at most countable basis. Then any homomorphism of representations $`\phi : V \to V` is a scalar operator.

Hint: By the usual Schur's lemma, the algebra $`D := \operatorname{End}_A(V)` is an algebra with division. Show that $`D` is at most countably dimensional. Suppose $`\phi` is not a scalar, and consider the subfield $`\mathbb{C}(\phi) \subset D`.
Show that $`\mathbb{C}(\phi)` is a transcendental extension of $`\mathbb{C}`. Derive from this that $`\mathbb{C}(\phi)` is uncountably dimensional and obtain a contradiction.
