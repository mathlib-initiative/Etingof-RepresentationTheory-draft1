*Definition 7.8.1.* A sequence of objects $`C_i, i \in \mathbb{Z}`, of an abelian category $`\mathcal{C}` and morphisms $`d_i : C_i \to C_{i+1}` is said to be *a complex* if the composition of any two consecutive arrows is zero. The morphisms $`d_i` are called the *differentials*.[^differentials] The *cohomology* of this complex is $`H^i = \operatorname{Ker}(d_i)/\operatorname{Im}(d_{i-1})`. The complex is said to be *exact* in the $`i`th term if $`H^i = 0` and is said to be *an exact sequence* if it is exact in all terms.

[^differentials]: A famous example of a complex is the *de Rham complex*, in which $`C_m` is the space of differential $`m`-forms on a Euclidean space or, more generally, a manifold, and $`d_m` is the exterior differential of differential forms. This explains the term "differential".
