Not every functor has a left or right adjoint, but if it does, it is unique and can be constructed canonically (i.e., if we somehow found two such functors, then there is a canonical isomorphism between them). This follows easily from the Yoneda lemma, since if $`F, G` are a pair of adjoint functors, then $`F(X)` represents the functor $`Y \mapsto \operatorname{Hom}(X, G(Y))` and $`G(Y)` represents the functor $`X \mapsto \operatorname{Hom}(F(X), Y)`.
