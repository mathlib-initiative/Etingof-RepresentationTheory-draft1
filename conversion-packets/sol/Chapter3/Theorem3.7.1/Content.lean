*Theorem 3.7.1* (Jordan-Holder theorem). _Let $`V` be a finite dimensional representation of $`A`, and let $`0 = V_0 \subset V_1 \subset \cdots \subset V_n = V`, $`0 = V'_0 \subset \cdots \subset V'_m = V` be filtrations of $`V`, such that the representations $`W_i := V_i/V_{i-1}` and $`W'_i := V'_i/V'_{i-1}` are irreducible for all $`i`. Then $`n = m`, and there exists a permutation $`\sigma` of $`1, \ldots, n` such that $`W_{\sigma(i)}` is isomorphic to $`W'_i`._

*Proof.* _First proof_ (for $`k` of characteristic zero). The character of $`V` obviously equals the sum of characters of $`W_i` and also the sum of characters of $`W'_i`. But by Theorem 3.6.2, the characters of irreducible representations are linearly independent, so the multiplicity of every irreducible representation $`W` of $`A` among $`W_i` and among $`W'_i` is the same. This implies the theorem.[^Chapter3/Theorem3.7.1/footnote-5]

_Second proof_ (general). The proof is by induction on $`\dim V`. The base of induction is clear, so let us prove the induction step. If $`W_1 = W'_1` (as subspaces), we are done, since by the induction assumption the theorem holds for $`V/W_1`. So assume $`W_1 \neq W'_1`. In this case $`W_1 \cap W'_1 = 0` (as $`W_1, W'_1` are irreducible), so we have an embedding $`f : W_1 \oplus W'_1 \to V`. Let $`U = V/(W_1 \oplus W'_1)`, and let $`0 = U_0 \subset U_1 \subset \cdots \subset U_p = U` be a filtration of $`U` with simple quotients $`Z_i = U_i/U_{i-1}` (it exists by Lemma 3.4.2). Then we see the following:

1) $`V/W_1` has a filtration with successive quotients $`W'_1, Z_1, \ldots, Z_p` and another filtration with successive quotients $`W_2, \ldots, W_n`.

[^Chapter3/Theorem3.7.1/footnote-5]: This proof does not work in characteristic $`p` because it only implies that the multiplicities of $`W_i` and $`W'_i` are the same modulo $`p`, which is not sufficient. In fact, the character of the representation $`pV`, where $`V` is any representation, is zero.

2) $`V/W'_1` has a filtration with successive quotients $`W_1, Z_1, \ldots, Z_p` and another filtration with successive quotients $`W'_2, \ldots, W'_m`.

By the induction assumption, this means that the collection of irreducible representations with multiplicities $`W_1, W'_1, Z_1, \ldots, Z_p` coincides on one hand with $`W_1, \ldots, W_n` and on the other hand with $`W'_1, \ldots, W'_m`. We are done. $`\square`
