*Remark 3.3.4.* Here is yet another proof of Theorem 3.3.1, using Lemma 3.1.6. Let $`X` be an $`n`-dimensional representation of $`A`. Let $`\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}` be a basis of $`X`. Then there is a unique homomorphism $`\psi : A^n \to X` such that $`\psi(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \sum_i a_i x_i`, and it is surjective. Hence $`X` is a quotient of $`A^n`. But we have seen that $`A = \bigoplus_{i=1}^r d_i V_i`,
hence $`A^n = \bigoplus_{i=1}^r n d_i V_i` as a representation of $`A`. Thus by Lemma 3.1.6, $`X = \bigoplus_{i=1}^r m_i V_i`, as desired.
