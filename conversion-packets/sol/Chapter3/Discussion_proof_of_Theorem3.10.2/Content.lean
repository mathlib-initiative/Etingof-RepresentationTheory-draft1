*Proof.* (i) By the density theorem, the maps $`A \to \operatorname{End} V` and $`B \to \operatorname{End} W` are surjective. Therefore, the map $`A \otimes B \to \operatorname{End} V \otimes \operatorname{End} W = \operatorname{End}(V \otimes W)` is surjective. Thus, $`V \otimes W` is irreducible.

(ii) First we show the existence of $`V` and $`W`. Let $`A', B'` be the images of $`A, B` in $`\operatorname{End} M`. Then $`A', B'` are finite dimensional algebras, and $`M` is a representation of $`A' \otimes B'`, so we may assume without loss of generality that $`A` and $`B` are finite dimensional.

In this case, we claim that

$$`\operatorname{Rad}(A \otimes B) = \operatorname{Rad}(A) \otimes B + A \otimes \operatorname{Rad}(B).`
Indeed, denote the latter by $`J`. Then $`J` is a nilpotent ideal in $`A \otimes B`, as $`\operatorname{Rad}(A)` and $`\operatorname{Rad}(B)` are nilpotent. On the other hand, $`(A \otimes B)/J = (A/\operatorname{Rad}(A)) \otimes (B/\operatorname{Rad}(B))`, which is a product of two semisimple algebras, hence semisimple. This implies $`J \supset \operatorname{Rad}(A \otimes B)`. Altogether, by Proposition 3.5.3, we see that $`J = \operatorname{Rad}(A \otimes B)`, proving the claim.

Thus, we see that

$$`(A \otimes B)/\operatorname{Rad}(A \otimes B) = A/\operatorname{Rad}(A) \otimes B/\operatorname{Rad}(B).`

Now, $`M` is an irreducible representation of $`(A \otimes B)/\operatorname{Rad}(A \otimes B)`, so it is clearly of the form $`M = V \otimes W`, where $`V` is an irreducible representation of $`A/\operatorname{Rad}(A)` and $`W` is an irreducible representation of $`B/\operatorname{Rad}(B)`. Also, $`V, W` are uniquely determined by $`M` (as all of the algebras involved are direct sums of matrix algebras). $`\square`
