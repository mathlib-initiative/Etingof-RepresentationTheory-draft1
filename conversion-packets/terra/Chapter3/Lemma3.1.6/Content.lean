*Lemma 3.1.6.* _There exists a subset $`J \subseteq I` such that $`V_J := \bigoplus_{i \in J} V_i` is mapped isomorphically by $`f` onto $`U`._

*Proof.* Let $`J` be a maximal subset such that $`f|_{V_J}` is injective. If $`f(V_J) \neq U`, then there exists $`i \in I` such that $`f(V_i)` is not contained in $`f(V_J)`. Then the map $`V_i \to U/f(V_J)` is nonzero, and hence injective by Schur's lemma. Let $`J' = J \cup \{i\}`; then $`f` is injective on $`V_{J'}`, contradicting the maximality of $`J`, which proves the lemma. $`\square`
