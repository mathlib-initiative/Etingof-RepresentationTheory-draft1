*Proposition 3.1.4.* _Let $`V_i`, $`1 \leq i \leq m`, be irreducible finite dimensional pairwise nonisomorphic representations of $`A`, and let $`W` be a subrepresentation of $`V = \bigoplus_{i=1}^m n_i V_i`. Then $`W` is isomorphic to $`\bigoplus_{i=1}^m r_i V_i`, $`r_i \leq n_i`, and the inclusion $`\phi : W \to V` is a direct sum of inclusions $`\phi_i : r_i V_i \to n_i V_i` given by multiplication of a row vector of elements of $`V_i` (of length $`r_i`) by a certain $`r_i \times n_i` matrix $`X_i` with linearly independent rows: $`\phi(v_1, \ldots, v_{r_i}) = (v_1, \ldots, v_{r_i}) X_i`._

*Proof.* The proof is by induction in $`n := \sum_{i=1}^m n_i`. The base of induction ($`n = 1`) is clear. To perform the induction step, let us assume that $`W` is nonzero, and fix an irreducible subrepresentation $`P \subset W`. Such $`P` exists (Problem 2.3.15).[^Chapter3/Proposition3.1.4/footnote-1] Now, by Schur's lemma, $`P` is isomorphic to $`V_i` for some $`i`, and the inclusion $`\phi|_P : P \to V` factors through $`n_i V_i` and upon identification of $`P` with $`V_i` is given by the formula $`v \mapsto (vq_1, \ldots, vq_{n_i})`, where $`q_l \in k` are not all zero.

Now note that the group $`G_i = GL_{n_i}(k)` of invertible $`n_i \times n_i` matrices over $`k` acts on $`n_i V_i` by $`(v_1, \ldots, v_{n_i}) \mapsto (v_1, \ldots, v_{n_i}) g_i` (and by the identity on $`n_j V_j`, $`j \neq i`) and therefore acts on the set of subrepresentations of $`V`, preserving the property we need to establish: namely, under the action of $`g_i`, the matrix $`X_i` goes to $`X_i g_i`, while the matrices $`X_j`, $`j \neq i`, don't change. Take $`g_i \in G_i` such that $`(q_1, \ldots, q_{n_i}) g_i = (1, 0, \ldots, 0)`. Then $`Wg_i` contains the first summand $`V_i` of $`n_i V_i` (namely, it is $`Pg_i`); hence $`Wg_i = V_i \oplus W'`, where $`W' \subset n_1 V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus (n_i - 1) V_i \oplus \cdots \oplus n_m V_m` is the kernel of the projection of $`Wg_i` to the first summand $`V_i` along the other summands. Thus the required statement follows from the induction assumption. $`\square`

[^Chapter3/Proposition3.1.4/footnote-1]: Another proof of the existence of $`P`, which does not use the finite dimensionality of $`V`, is by induction in $`n`. Namely, if $`W` itself is not irreducible, let $`K` be the kernel of the projection of $`W` to the first summand $`V_1`. Then $`K` is a subrepresentation of $`(n_1 - 1)V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus n_m V_m`, which is nonzero since $`W` is not irreducible, so $`K` contains an irreducible subrepresentation by the induction assumption.
