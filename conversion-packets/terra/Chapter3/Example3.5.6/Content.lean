*Example 3.5.6.* 1. Let $`A = k[x]/(x^n)`. This algebra has a unique irreducible representation, which is a 1-dimensional space $`k`, in which $`x` acts by zero. So the radical $`\operatorname{Rad}(A)` is the ideal $`(x)`.

2. Let $`A` be the algebra of upper triangular $`n \times n` matrices. It is easy to check that the irreducible representations of $`A` are $`V_i`, $`i = 1, \ldots, n`, which are 1-dimensional, and any matrix $`x` acts by $`x_{ii}`. So the radical $`\operatorname{Rad}(A)` is the ideal of strictly upper triangular matrices (as it is a nilpotent ideal and contains the radical). A similar result holds for block-triangular matrices.
