*Remark 3.1.3.* Note that by Schur's lemma, any semisimple finite dimensional representation $`V` of $`A` is canonically identified with $`\bigoplus_X \operatorname{Hom}_A(X, V) \otimes X`, where $`X` runs over all irreducible representations of $`A`. Indeed, we have a natural map $`f : \bigoplus_X \operatorname{Hom}(X, V) \otimes X \to V`, given by $`g \otimes x \to g(x)`, $`x \in X`, $`g \in \operatorname{Hom}(X, V)`, and it is easy to verify that this map is an isomorphism. Indeed, if the result holds for representations $`V_i` for $`i \in I`, then it holds for their direct sum. Therefore one may assume that $`V` is irreducible.
