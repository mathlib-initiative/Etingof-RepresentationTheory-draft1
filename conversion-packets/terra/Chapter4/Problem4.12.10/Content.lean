*Problem 4.12.10.* Let $`G` be a finite group and let $`V` be a complex representation of $`G` which is faithful, i.e., the corresponding map $`G \to GL(V)` is injective. Show that any irreducible representation of $`G` occurs inside $`S^nV` (and hence inside $`V^{\otimes n}`) for some $`n`.

Hint: Show that there exists a vector $`u \in V^*` whose stabilizer in $`G` is 1. Now define the map $`SV \to F(G, \mathbb{C})` sending a polynomial $`f` on $`V^*` to the function $`f_u` on $`G` given by $`f_u(g) = f(gu)`. Show that this map is surjective and use this to deduce the desired result.
