If $`V` is a finite dimensional representation of a finite group $`G`, then its character $`\chi_V : G \to k` is defined by the formula $`\chi_V(g) = \operatorname{Tr}|_V(\rho(g))`. Obviously, $`\chi_V(g)` is simply the restriction of the character $`\chi_V(a)` of $`V` as a representation of the algebra $`A = k[G]` to the basis $`G \subset A`, so it carries exactly the same information. The character is a *central function*, or *class function*: $`\chi_V(g)` depends only on the conjugacy class of $`g`; i.e., $`\chi_V(hgh^{-1}) = \chi_V(g)`.

Denote by $`F(G, k)` the space of $`k`-valued functions on $`G` and by $`F_c(G, k) \subset F(G, k)` the subspace of class functions.
