*Proof of Burnside's theorem.* Assume Burnside's theorem is false. Then there exists a nonsolvable group $`G` of order $`p^a q^b`. Let $`G` be the smallest such group. Then $`G` is simple, and by Theorem 5.4.6, it cannot have a conjugacy class of order $`p^k` or $`q^k`, $`k \geq 1`. So the order of any conjugacy class in $`G` either equals 1 or is divisible by $`pq`. Adding the orders of conjugacy classes and equating the sum to $`p^a q^b`, we see that there has to be more than one conjugacy class consisting just of one element. So $`G` has a nontrivial center, which gives a contradiction. $`\square`
