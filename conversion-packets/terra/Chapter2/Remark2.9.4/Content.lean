*Remark 2.9.4.* Derivations are important because they are the "infinitesimal version" of automorphisms (i.e., isomorphisms onto itself). For example, assume that $`g(t)` is a differentiable family of automorphisms of a finite dimensional algebra $`A` over $`\mathbb{R}` or $`\mathbb{C}` parametrized by $`t \in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)` such that $`g(0) = \mathrm{Id}`. Then $`D := g'(0) : A \to A` is a derivation (check it!). Conversely, if $`D : A \to A` is a derivation, then $`e^{tD}` is a 1-parameter family of automorphisms (give a proof!).

This provides a motivation for the notion of a Lie algebra. Namely, we see that Lie algebras arise as spaces of infinitesimal automorphisms (= derivations) of associative algebras. In fact, they similarly arise as spaces of derivations of any kind of linear algebraic structures, such as Lie algebras, Hopf algebras, etc., and for this reason play a very important role in algebra.
