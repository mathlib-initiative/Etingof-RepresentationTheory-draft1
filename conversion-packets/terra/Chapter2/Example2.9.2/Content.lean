*Example 2.9.2.* Some examples of Lie algebras are:

(1) Any space $`\mathfrak{g}` with $`[\ ,\ ] = 0` (abelian Lie algebra).

(2) Any associative algebra $`A` with $`[a, b] = ab - ba`, in particular, the endomorphism algebra $`A = \operatorname{End}(V)`, where $`V` is a vector space. When such an $`A` is regarded as a Lie algebra, it is often denoted by $`\mathfrak{gl}(V)` (general linear Lie algebra).

(3) Any subspace $`U` of an associative algebra $`A` such that $`[a, b] \in U` for all $`a, b \in U`.

(4) The space $`\operatorname{Der}(A)` of derivations of an algebra $`A`, i.e. linear maps $`D : A \to A` which satisfy the Leibniz rule:

$$`D(ab) = D(a)b + aD(b).`
