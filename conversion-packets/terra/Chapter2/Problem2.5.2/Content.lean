*Problem 2.5.2.* Let $`V \neq 0` be a representation of $`A`. We say that a vector $`v \in V` is *cyclic* if it generates $`V`, i.e., $`Av = V`. A representation admitting a cyclic vector is said to be *cyclic*. Show the following:

(a) $`V` is irreducible if and only if all nonzero vectors of $`V` are cyclic.

(b) $`V` is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to $`A/I`, where $`I` is a left ideal in $`A`.

(c) Give an example of an indecomposable representation which is not cyclic.

Hint: Let $`A = \mathbb{C}[x, y]/I_2`, where $`I_2` is the ideal spanned by homogeneous polynomials of degree $`\geq 2` (so $`A` has a basis $`1, x, y`). Let $`V = A^*` be the space of linear functionals on $`A`, with the action of $`A` given by $`(\rho(a)f)(b) = f(ba)`. Show that $`V` provides such an example.
